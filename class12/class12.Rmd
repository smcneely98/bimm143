### 1.1 PDB Statistics

> Q1: Determine the percentage of structures solved by X-Ray and EM. Determine what proportion of structures are proteins.

```{r}
# Read in file
stats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")

# Calculate percentage of solved by each method
solvedMethod <- stats$Total / sum(stats$Total) * 100
names(solvedMethod) <- rownames(stats)
round(solvedMethod, 2)
```

```{r}
round(sum(stats$Proteins / sum(stats$Total) * 100), 2)
```


> Q2: Determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB.
